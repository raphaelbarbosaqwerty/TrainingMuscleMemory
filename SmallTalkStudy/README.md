# SmallTalkStudy
Decide to start my studies with SmallTalk to better understand OOP  

### Starting with SmallTalk
First you need to install GNU SmallTalk virtual machine
```
ubuntu/debian: # apt-get install gnu-smalltalk
arch: # pacman -S smalltalk
```
After you have the SmallTalk virtual machine we can enter in interactive mode
```
$ gst -q
st> 'Hello World!' printNl !
'Hello World!'
```
